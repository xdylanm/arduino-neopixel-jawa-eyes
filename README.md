# Neo Pixel Jawa Eyes

Example of using a Circuit Playground to control two strings of Neo Pixels as eyes for a Jawa costume. Each string has six pixels. The Circuit Playground library (https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPlayground)  is used ({{Adafruit_CPlay_NeoPixel}}) instead of the generic Adafruit_Neopixel library (https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_NeoPixel) to avoid a link conflict.
