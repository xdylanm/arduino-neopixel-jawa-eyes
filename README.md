# Neo Pixel Jawa Eyes

Example of using a Circuit Playground to control two strings of Neo Pixels as eyes for a Jawa costume. Each string has six pixels. The [Adafruit_CircuitPlayground library](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPlayground)  is used (`Adafruit_CPlay_NeoPixel`) instead of the generic [Adafruit_Neopixel library](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_NeoPixel) to avoid a link conflict.
